“I’m… I’m alone.”


You look before space, your husband and twelve children are in your goose-craft, but the airlock raft opened when you were checking the engine, and here you are.


You landed in Scuffed Green Hill.


You never thought you would be here. You thought your family would forever be safe.


But everyone should know…


You can never escape Scuffed Green Hill.
